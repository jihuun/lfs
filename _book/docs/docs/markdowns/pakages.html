<p>v. Rationale for Packages in the Book</p>
<p>As stated earlier, the goal of LFS is to build a complete and usable
foundation-level system. This includes all packages needed to replicate itself
while providing a relatively minimal base from which to customize a more
    complete system based on the choices of the user. This does not mean
    that LFS is the smallest system possible. Several important packages
    are included that are not strictly required. The lists below document
    the rationale for each package in the book.</p>
<h3 id="acl">Acl</h3>
<p>This package contains utilities to administer Access Control Lists, which are
used to define more fine-grained discretionary access rights for files and
directories.</p>
<h3 id="attr">Attr</h3>
<p>This package contains programs for administering extended attributes on
filesystem objects.
